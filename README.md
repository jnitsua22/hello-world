# hello-world
My first suppos... I mean repository lol

Hello world, again! I don't know how many times I'm going to greet you - and it's starting to get a little repetitive,
but I guess I don't mind since you don't mind listening to me as I learn about computer programming using version control
on GitHub for the first time. If you can't tell, I'm often quite cheesy and don't mind a light-hearted joke or two. My
programming knowledge currently includes a strong constricting snake, coffee, and 70-79.4% (that is, python, java, and C).
